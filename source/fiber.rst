Fibers
======

Introduction
------------

Tarantool uses cooperative multitasking via that named fibers.
They are similar to well known threads except they are not running
simultaneously but must be scheduled explicitly.

Fibers are coupled into cords (in turn the cords are real threads,
thus fibers inside a cord are executing in a sequent way while several
cords may run simultaneously).

When we create a fiber we provide a function to be invoked upon fiber's
start, lets call it a fiber function to distinguish from other
service routines.

Event library
-------------

The heart of Tarantool fibers schedule is ``libev`` library. As its
name implies the library provides an loop which get interrupted when an
event arrive. We won't jump into internals of ``libev`` but provide
only a few code snippets to draw a basic workflow

.. code-block:: c

    ev_run (int flags) {
        do {
            //...
            backend_poll(waittime);
            //...
            EV_INVOKE_PENDING;
        }
    }

The ``backend_poll`` invokes low level service call (such as ``epoll`` or
``select`` depending on operating system, please see their man pages)
to fetch events. Evens are explicitly passed to queue via API ``libev``
provides to programmers. The service call supports ``waittime`` timeout,
so if no events available a new wait iteration started or polling to be precise.
The typical minimal ``waittime`` is 1 millisecond.

The ``EV_INVOKE_PENDING`` fetches events to process and runs associated
callbacks for this iteration. Once callbacks are finished a new iteration
begins.

Pushing new event into the queue is provided by ``ev_feed_event`` call
and Tarantool use it under the hood.

Fibers engine overview
----------------------

The main cord defined as

.. code-block:: c

    static struct cord main_cord;
    __thread struct cord *cord_ptr = NULL;
    #define cord()    cord_ptr
    #define fiber()   cord()->fiber
    #define loop()    (cord()->loop)

Note the ``cord()``, ``fiber()`` and ``loop()`` helper macros.
They are used frequently to access currently executing cord,
fiber and event loop.

The cord structure is the following (note that we are posting stripped
versions of structures in sake of simplicity)

.. code-block:: c

    struct cord {
        // Running fiber
        struct fiber        *fiber;

        // Libev loop
        struct ev_loop      *loop;

        // Fiber's ID map
        struct mh_i32ptr_t  *fiber_registry;

        // All fibers
        struct rlist        alive;

        // Fibers ready for execution
        struct rlist        ready;

        // Fibers for recycling
        struct rlist        dead;

        // Scheduler
        struct fiber        sched;

        // Cord name
        char                name[FIBER_NAME_MAX];
    }

The most important members are
 - ``fiber`` is a currently executing fiber
 - ``sched`` is a service fiber which schedules all other fibers in the cord

The fiber structure is the following

.. code-block:: c

    struct fiber {
        // The fiber to be scheduled
        // when this one yields
        struct fiber    *caller;

        // Fiber ID
        uint32_t        fid;

        // To link with cord's
        // @alive or @dead lists
        struct rlist    link;

        // To link with cord's @ready list
        struct rlist    state;

        // Fibers waiting for this
        // instance to finish.
        struct rlist    wake;

        // Fiber function, its
        // arguments and return code
        fiber_func      f;
        va_list         f_data;
        int             f_ret;
    }

When Tarantool starts it creates the main cord

.. code-block:: c

    main(int argc, char **argv)
        fiber_init(fiber_cxx_invoke);
            fiber_invoke = fiber_cxx_invoke;
            main_thread_id = pthread_self();
            main_cord.loop = ev_default_loop();
            cord_create(&main_cord, "main");

Don't pay attention on ``fiber_cxx_invoke`` for now, it is just
a wrapper to run a fiber function.

The cord creation is the following

.. code-block:: c

    cord_create(&main_cord, "main");
        cord() = cord;
        cord->id = pthread_self();

        rlist_create(&cord->alive);
        rlist_create(&cord->ready);
        rlist_create(&cord->dead);

        cord->fiber_registry = mh_i32ptr_new();
        cord->sched.fid = 1;
        fiber_set_name(&cord->sched, "sched");

        cord->fiber = &cord->sched;

        ev_async_init(&cord->wakeup_event, fiber_schedule_wakeup);
        ev_idle_init(&cord->idle_event, fiber_schedule_idle);

When the cord is created the **scheduler fiber** ``cord->sched``
becomes its primary one. Think of it as a main fiber which will
switch all other fibers in this cord.

Note that here we setup ``cord()`` macro to point to ``main_cord``,
thus ``fiber()`` will point to main cord scheduler fiber and
``loop()`` will be ``ev_default_loop``.

Abstract description is not very useful so lets look how Tarantool
boots in interactive console mode (the mode is not really important
here but rather a call graph).

.. code-block:: c

    main
        fiber_init(fiber_cxx_invoke);
        tarantool_lua_run_script
            script_fiber = fiber_new(title, run_script_f);
                fiber_new_ex
                    cord = cord();
                    fiber = mempool_alloc()
                    coro_create(..., fiber_loop,...)
                    rlist_add_entry(&cord->alive, fiber, link);
                    register_fid(fiber);

Here we create a new fiber to run ``run_script_f`` fiber
function. ``fiber_new`` allocates a new fiber instance
(actually there is a fiber cache so that if a previous fiber
already finished its work and exited we can reuse it without
calling ``mempool_alloc`` but this is just an optimization
for speed sake), then we chain it into the main cord's
``alive`` list and register in fiber IDs pool.

One of the clue here is ``coro_create`` call, where "coro"
stands for "coroutine". Coroutines are implemented via ``coro``
library. On Linux it simply handles hardware context to reload
registers and jump into desired function. More precisely the heart of "coro"
library is ``coro_transfer(&from, &to)`` routine which remembers current
point of execution (``from``) and transfer flow to the new instruction
pointer provided (``to`` which is created during ``coro_create``).

Note that the fiber function is wrapped by ``fiber_loop``.
This is because the fiber function itself may not call scheduler
explicitly but we have to pass execution to others fibers, thus
we simply call fiber function manually inside ``fiber_loop``
and reschedule then.

.. code-block:: c

    fiber_loop(MAYBE_UNUSED void *data)
        ...
        fiber->f_ret = fiber_invoke(fiber->f, fiber->f_data);
        fiber->flags |= FIBER_IS_DEAD;
        while (!rlist_empty(&fiber->wake)) {
            // some another fiber waits us to complete
            // via fiber_join()
            f = rlist_shift_entry(&fiber->wake, struct fiber,
                                  state);
            fiber_wakeup(f);
                ...
                rlist_move_tail_entry(&cord->ready, f, state);
        }

        if (!(fiber->flags & FIBER_IS_JOINABLE))
            fiber_recycle(fiber);

        fiber->f = NULL;
        fiber_yield();

Some fibers may wait for others to be finished, for this sake we
move them to ``ready`` list of the cord first, then we try to
put the fiber into a cache pool to recycle it (thus don't allocate
memory again) via ``fiber_recycle`` and finally we move execution
flow back to the scheduler fiber via ``fiber_yield``.

Fibers do not start execution automatically, we have to call
``fiber_start``. Thus back to Tarantool startup

.. code-block:: c

    tarantool_lua_run_script
        script_fiber = fiber_new(title, run_script_f);
        fiber_start(script_fiber, ...)
            fiber_call(...)
                fiber_call_impl(...)
                    coro_transfer(...)
        ev_run(loop(), 0);

Here once the fiber is created we kick it to execute. This is done
inside ``fiber_call_impl`` which uses ``core_transfer``
routine to jump into ``fiber_loop`` and invoke ``run_script_f``
inside.

The ``run_script_f`` shows a good example how to give execution
back to scheduler fiber and continue

.. code-block:: c

    run_script_f
        ...
        fiber_sleep(0.0);
        ...

When ``fiber_sleep`` is called the ``coro`` switch execution
to the scheduler fiber

.. code-block:: c

    fiber_sleep(double delay)
        ...
        fiber_yield_timeout(delay);
            ...
            fiber_yield();
                cord = cord();
                caller->caller = &cord->sched;
                coro_transfer(&caller->ctx, &callee->ctx);

Once ``coro`` jumped into scheduler fiber another fiber is
chosen to execute. At some moment scheduler return execution
to the point after ``fiber_sleep(0.0)`` and we step up back
to ``tarantool_lua_run_script`` and run main event loop
``ev_run(loop(), 0)``. Now all future execution will be driven
by ``libev`` and by events we supply into the queue.

The full description of the fiber API is provided in Tarantool
manual but we mention a few just to complete this introduction:

 - ``cord_create`` to create a new cord;
 - ``fiber_new`` to create a new fiber but not run it;
 - ``fiber_start`` to execute a fiber immediately;
 - ``fiber_cancel`` to cancel execution of a fiber;
 - ``fiber_join`` to wait for a cancelled fiber;
 - ``fiber_yield`` to switch execution to another fiber,
   the execution will back to the point after this call later.
   By later we mean that some other fiber will call ``fiber_wakeup``
   on this fiber, until then it won't be scheduled. This is the key
   function of fibers switch;
 - ``fiber_sleep`` to sleep some time giving execution
   to another fibers;
 - ``fiber_yield_timeout`` to give execution to another
   fibers with some timeout value;
 - ``fiber_reschedule`` give execution to another fibers.
   In contrast with plain ``fiber_yield`` we are moving self
   to the end of cord's ``ready`` list. We will grab execution
   back when all fibers already waiting for execution are
   processed.

Fiber's scheduling
------------------

Due to cooperative multitasking we have to provide scheduling points explicitly.
Still from API point of view it is not very clear how exactly fibers are chosen
for execution and how they are managed on low level. Here we explain some details.

Each cord has a statically allocated scheduler fiber. Lets look again into a cord
and fiber structure and put comments on their linking.

.. code-block:: c

    struct cord {
        // Currently executing fiber
        struct fiber        *fiber;

        // Newly created fibers
        struct rlist        alive;

        // Fibers to wake up
        struct rlist        ready;

        // Dead fibers for reuse
        struct rlist        dead;

        // Main scheduler fiber
        struct fiber        sched;

        // Binds to event library
        struct ev_loop      *loop;
        ev_async            wakeup_event;
        ev_idle             idle_event;
    };

    struct fiber {
        struct fiber        *caller;

        // To carry FIBER_IS_x flags
        uint32_t            flags;

        // Link into @cord->alive or @cord->dead
        struct rlist        link;

        // Link into @cord->ready
        struct rlist        state;

        // Fibers to wake when this fiber is exiting
        struct rlist        wake;
    }

Lets put transition schematics immediately so the next explanation will be pictured.

.. code-block:: text

    Prepend newly created fibers to the list

    cord_X->alive
            `-> fiber_1->link
            `-> fiber_2->link
            `-> fiber_x->link

    Once fiber is exited cache it moving from @alive to @dead list

    cord_X->alive
            `-x fiber_1->link ---
            `-x fiber_2->link -- `
            `-x fiber_x->link - ` `
                               `-`-`-> cord_X->dead

    Instead of creating new fibers we can reuse exited ones

    cord_X->dead
            `-x fiber_1->link ---
            `-x fiber_2->link -- `
            `-x fiber_x->link - ` `
                               `-`-`-> cord_X->alive

Now back to the cord structure. Note that ``cord->sched`` is not a pointer but embedded
complete structure. So when cord is created the ``sched`` is initialized manually.

.. code-block:: c

    void
    cord_create(struct cord *cord, const char *name)
    {
        // To control children fibers state
        rlist_create(&cord->alive);
        rlist_create(&cord->ready);
        rlist_create(&cord->dead);

        cord->sched.fid = FIBER_ID_SCHED;
        fiber_reset(&cord->sched);
        fiber_set_name(&cord->sched, "sched");
        cord->fiber = &cord->sched;

        // Event loop will trigger this helpers
        ev_async_init(&cord->wakeup_event, fiber_schedule_wakeup);
        ev_idle_init(&cord->idle_event, fiber_schedule_idle);

        // No need for separate stack
        cord->sched.stack = NULL;
        cord->sched.stack_size = 0;
    }

The ``cord->sched`` does not even have a separate stack because the cord and
its scheduler are executed inside a main thread itself (actually cord may be
running inside separate thread as well but still doesn't require own stack
to have).

Binding to ``libev`` is done via ``ev_async_init`` and ``ev_idle_init`` calls.

When that named *idle* state comes in (ie the state where we have no event to handle)
then ``fiber_schedule_idle`` is executed. Currently ``fiber_schedule_idle`` does simply
nothing and rather reserved for future use.

In turn ``fiber_schedule_wakeup`` bound to ``ev_async_init``. The asynchronous event
is bound to a special pipe inside ``libev`` so that such events will have maximal
priority to deliver. Thus when we trigger ``fiber_schedule_wakeup`` it will be handled
with high priority (not immediately though, event feeding means that we've put it into
a pipe).

Now lets create a new fiber and run it.

.. code-block:: c

    struct fiber *
    fiber_new_ex(const char *name, const struct fiber_attr *fiber_attr, fiber_func f)
    {
        struct cord *cord = cord();

        //
        // Either take the fiber from cache, or allocate a new one
        if (!rlist_empty(&cord->dead)) {
            //
            // When reuse fiber we move it from
            // @dead list and prepend @alive
            fiber = rlist_first_entry(&cord->dead, struct fiber, link);
            rlist_move_entry(&cord->alive, fiber, link);
        } else {
            fiber = mempool_alloc(&cord->fiber_mempool);
            rlist_create(&fiber->state);
            rlist_create(&fiber->wake);

            // New fiber created, prepend @alive
            rlist_add_entry(&cord->alive, fiber, link);
        }

        // Main function to run when fiber is executing
        fiber->f = f;

        // New fibers are prepends the @cord->alive list
    }

Upon a new fiber creation we put it to the head of ``cord->alive`` list via
``fiber->link`` list. It is not running yet we have to give it an execution
slot explicitly via ``fiber_start`` call (which just a wrapper over ``fiber_call``).

.. code-block:: c

    void
    fiber_start(struct fiber *callee, ...)
    {
        va_start(callee->f_data, callee);
        fiber_call(callee);
        va_end(callee->f_data);
    }

    void
    fiber_call(struct fiber *callee)
    {
        callee->caller = caller;
        callee->flags |= FIBER_IS_READY;
        caller->flags |= FIBER_IS_READY;

        fiber_call_impl(callee);
    }

The fiber to execute remembers its caller via ``fiber::caller``. And the
``fiber_call_impl`` does a real transfer of an execution context.

.. code-block:: c

    static void
    fiber_call_impl(struct fiber *callee)
    {
        struct fiber *caller = fiber();
        struct cord *cord = cord();

        // Remember the fiber we're executing now.
        cord->fiber = callee;

        callee->flags &= ~FIBER_IS_READY;
        coro_transfer(&caller->ctx, &callee->ctx);
    }

We set the currently running fiber to ``cord->fiber`` and jump into fiber's execution.
Note at this moment the fiber is sitting in ``cord->alive`` list. Same time we drop
``FIBER_IS_READY`` flag from us since we're already executing and if we're trying
to wakeup self we will exit early.

Once we start executing we could either

 - finish execution explicitly, exiting from fiber's function ``f`` we passed
   as an argument upon fiber creation;
 - Give execution slot to some other fiber via ``fiber_yield`` call.

Fiber exit
~~~~~~~~~~

When fiber is exiting the execution flow returns to ``fiber_loop``.

.. code-block:: c

    static void
    fiber_loop(MAYBE_UNUSED void *data)
    {
        for (;;) {
            struct fiber *fiber = fiber();
            fiber->f_ret = fiber_invoke(fiber->f, fiber->f_data);

            //
            // Upon exit we return to this point since fiber_invoke
            // finished its execution
            //

            fiber->flags |= FIBER_IS_DEAD;

            //
            // Wakeup all waiters
            while (!rlist_empty(&fiber->wake)) {
                struct fiber *f;

                f = rlist_shift_entry(&fiber->wake, struct fiber, state);
                fiber_wakeup(f);
            }

            //
            // Remove penging wakeups
            rlist_del(&fiber->state);

            //
            // Put into dead fibers cache for reuse
            // in case if fiber is not joinable
            if (!(fiber->flags & FIBER_IS_JOINABLE))
                fiber_recycle(fiber);

            //
            // Give execution back to the main scheduler
            fiber_yield();
        }
    }

In simple scenario we just move this fiber to the ``cord->dead`` list via
``fiber_recycle`` and reuse it later when we need to create a new fiber.

An interesting scenario is where there are some waiters. *Waiters* mean that there
are some fibers which waits for our exit. In terms of API it means that another fiber
has called ``fiber_join_timeout``.

.. code-block:: c

    int
    fiber_join(struct fiber *fiber)
    {
        return fiber_join_timeout(fiber, TIMEOUT_INFINITY);
    }

    int
    fiber_join_timeout(struct fiber *fiber, double timeout)
    {
        if (!fiber_is_dead(fiber)) {
            bool exceeded = false;
            do {
                rlist_add_tail_entry(&fiber->wake, fiber(), state);

                if (timeout != TIMEOUT_INFINITY) {
                    double time = fiber_clock();
                    exceeded = fiber_yield_timeout(timeout);
                    timeout -= (fiber_clock() - time);
                } else {
                    fiber_yield();
                }
            } (!fiber_is_dead(fiber) && ! exceeded && timeout > 0);
        }

        if (!fiber_is_dead(fiber)) {
            diag_set(TimedOut);
            return -1;
        }

        fiber_recycle(fiber);
    }

The key moment here is that target fiber which we are waiting to exit
puts us to own ``fiber->wake`` list. Thus we become a *waiting* fiber
and calls ``fiber_yield`` all the time (we don't consider a case where
we wait with timeout because the only difference is that we can exit
earlier due to timeout expiration) skipping our execution slot giving
control back to the scheduler. The target fiber will wake us upon its
completion. It is done via tail of ``fiber_loop`` call. Lets repeat
this moment

.. code-block:: c

    static void
    fiber_loop(MAYBE_UNUSED void *data)
    {
        for (;;) {
            //
            // Fiber finished execution.
            //

            //
            // Wakeup all waiters
            while (!rlist_empty(&fiber->wake)) {
                struct fiber *f;
                f = rlist_shift_entry(&fiber->wake, struct fiber, state);
                fiber_wakeup(f);
            }

            //
            // Give control back to scheduler
            fiber_yield();
        }
    }

Thus here is an interesting transition. Lets assume we've a few fibers:
``fiber-1`` and ``fiber-2``. Both are not running just hanging in ``cord->alive``
list.

.. code-block:: text

    cord->alive
            `-> fiber-1->link
            `-> fiber-2->link

Then we need the ``fiber-2`` to wait until ``fiber-1`` is finished. So we mark
``fiber-1`` via ``fiber_set_joinable(fiber-1, true)`` and then start waiting
for it to complete via ``fiber_join(fiber-1)`` call. The ``fiber_join`` simply
gives execution slot to the scheduler which runs ``fiber-1``. Once ``fiber-1``
finishes it notifies scheduler to wake up waiting ``fiber-2`` and enters into
``fiber_yield``. Then scheduler finally gives execution back to ``fiber-2`` which
in turn rips ``fiber-1`` via ``fiber_recycle`` and continue own execution.

Here is how this transition goes.

Fiber yield
~~~~~~~~~~~

Now lets look into ``fiber_yield`` implementation.

.. code-block:: c

    void
    fiber_yield(void)
    {
        struct cord *cord = cord();
        struct fiber *caller = cord->fiber;
        struct fiber *callee = caller->caller;
        caller->caller = &cord->sched;

        cord->fiber = callee;
        callee->flags &= ~FIBER_IS_READY;
        coro_transfer(&caller->ctx, &callee->ctx);
    }

The ``caller`` is our fiber which calls ``fiber_yield`` and the fiber to
switch execution to is our ``fiber->caller`` member.

Initially this ``fiber->caller`` is set in ``fiber_call`` routine. In
other word when fiber is executed for first time because there must
be some parent fiber which created and run the new fibers.

.. code-block:: text

    cord->sched
            `<- fiber_1->caller
                 `<- fiber_2->caller
                      `-> fiber_yield()

                      switch to fiber_1

                             |
                             V

    cord->sched
            `<- fiber_2->caller
            `<- fiber_1->caller

So using ``caller`` value we switch execution to ``fiber_1`` because
it is a parent of ``fiber_2`` but this is a one shot action. Same time
we reset ``fiber_1`` caller to the main scheduler ``cord->sched`` so the
next time these fibers will be running ``fiber_yield`` the execution will
be transferred to the scheduler.

Fiber wakeup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a fiber suspended own execution slot to the caller (either a parent
fiber or the scheduler) it simply sits in memory doing nothing and someone
has to wake it up and run again. The parent (or any other fiber) has to call
``fiber_wakeup`` with this suspended fiber as an argument.


.. code-block:: c

    void
    fiber_wakeup(struct fiber *f)
    {
        //
        // Exit early if calling fiber_wakeup on self
        // or dead fibers
        if (f->flags & (FIBER_IS_READY | FIBER_IS_DEAD))
            return;

        //
        // Notify scheduler to execute fiber_schedule_wakeup
        struct cord *cord = cord();
        if (rlist_empty(&cord->ready))
            ev_feed_event(cord->loop, &cord->wakeup_event, EV_CUSTOM);

        // Move the target fiber to the @ready list
        rlist_move_tail_entry(&cord->ready, f, state);
        f->flags |= FIBER_IS_READY;
    }

The ``fiber_wakeup`` notifies ``cord->wakeup_event`` listener that there
is an event to process. This will cause ``fiber_schedule_wakeup`` to run
once ``libev`` obtain control back. Then the target fiber is *appended*
to the ``cord->ready`` list. The order is important because we highly
depend on transactions order and WAL processing.

Note that calling ``fiber_wakeup`` does not cause ``fiber_schedule_wakeup``
to run immediately. The caller should give execution back to the scheduler
explicitly (via same ``fiber_yield`` for example).

Finally the ``fiber_schedule_wakeup`` takes place

.. code-block:: c

    static void
    fiber_schedule_wakeup(ev_loop *loop, ev_async *watcher, int revents)
    {
        struct cord *cord = cord();
        fiber_schedule_list(&cord->ready);
    }

    fiber_schedule_list(struct rlist *list)
    {
        struct fiber *first;
        struct fiber *last;

        //
        // The fibers might be dead already
        if (rlist_empty(list))
            return;

        //
        // Traverse the queued fibers clearing the
        // @ready list and serialize the callers.
        first = last = rlist_shift_entry(list, struct fiber, state);
        while (!rlist_empty(list)) {
            last->caller = rlist_shift_entry(list, struct fiber, state);
            last = last->caller;
        }

        //
        // Set the caller to main scheduler of the last
        // entry from the @ready list, so its fiber_yeld
        // transfer execution back.
        last->caller = &cord()->sched;

        //
        // And start execution of the first fiber.
        fiber_call_impl(first);
    }

This is nontrivial code. There might be a series of ``fiber_wakeup`` calls
during some fiber execution. They are all queued in the ``cord->ready``
list. When we start execution of the scheduling routine the fibers might
be dead already so we exit early since there is nothing to execute.

Same time if the queue is not empty we try to serialize the ``fiber->caller``
chain. We traverse the ``cord->ready`` list left to right (remember the
fibers are appended to this list when ``fiber_wakeup`` is called) and
make each fiber be a parent of the next one. The last entry in the list
use main scheduler ``cord()->sched`` as a parent.

And finally we run first queued fiber. When it call ``fiber_yield`` then
the next previously queued fiber will be executed. Lets try to draw the
transition.

Assume there is 3 fibers which creates each other in sequence.

.. code-block:: text

   cord->sched <---+
    `              |
     fiber-1       | <-+
      ` `- caller -+   |
      `                |
       `- fiber-2      | <-+
         `  `- caller -+   |
          `                |
           `- fiber-3 <~~~~|~~ running
                `- caller -+

Lets presume the ``fiber-3`` is running and calls ``fiber_yield``, then
we make its parent be ``cord->sched`` and transfer execution to ``fiber-2``.

.. code-block:: text

   cord->sched <---+-------+
    `              |       |
     fiber-1       | <-+   |
      ` `- caller -+   |   |
      `                |   |
       `- fiber-2 <~~~~|~~~|~~ running
         `  `- caller -+   |
          `                |
           `- fiber-3      |
                `- caller -+

In turn ``fiber-2`` does the same and calls ``fiber_yield`` too so the execution
comes back to ``fiber-1``.

.. code-block:: text

   cord->sched <---+---+---+
    `              |   |   |
     fiber-1 <~~~~~|~~~|~~~|~~ running
      ` `- caller -+   |   |
      `                |   |
       `- fiber-2      |   |
         `  `- caller -+   |
          `                |
           `- fiber-3      |
                `- caller -+

Then ``fiber-1`` runs ``fiber_wakeup(fiber-2)``, ``fiber_wakeup(fiber-3)``
and ``fiber_yield``.

.. code-block:: text

   cord->sched <---+---+---+
    `              |   |   |
     fiber-1 <~~~~~|~~~|~~~|~~ running
      ` `- caller -+   |   |
      `                |   |
       `- fiber-2      |   |
         `  `- caller -+   |
          `                |
           `- fiber-3      |
                `- caller -+

                    |
                    V

        fiber-1: fiber_wakeup(fiber-2)
        fiber-1: fiber_wakeup(fiber-3)

                    |
                    V

        cord->alive { fiber-2, fiber-3 }

                    |
                    V

        fiber-1: fiber_yield() -> execute fiber_schedule_wakeup()

                    |
                    V

   cord->sched <---+--------+     +-- fiber_schedule_wakeup --+
    `              |        |     |                           |
     fiber-1 ~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~|~~~> fiber_yield() ->            |
      ` `- caller -+        |                                 |
      `                     |                                 V
       `- fiber-2 <~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~ running ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
         `  `- caller --+   |
          `             |   |
           `- fiber-3 <-+   |
                `- caller --+

When ``fiber-1`` calls ``fiber_yield`` the main scheduler obtains the execution
slot and reorders ``caller`` chain so that ``fiber-2`` starts running but its
``caller`` now points to ``fiber-3``, and when ``fiber-2`` calls ``fiber_yield()``
the next target to execute is ``fiber-3``.

When ``fiber-3`` make own ``fiber_yield()`` the transition goes back to the
main scheduler and ``caller`` for all three fibers point to main
scheduler again.

.. code-block:: text

   cord->sched <---+---+---+   <~~~ running
    `              |   |   |
     fiber-1       |   |   |
      ` `- caller -+   |   |
      `                |   |
       `- fiber-2      |   |
         `  `- caller -+   |
          `                |
           `- fiber-3      |
                `- caller -+

Thus the only purpose of ``fiber_wakeup`` is to order execution of
other fibers.
