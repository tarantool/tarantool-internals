# Memory management

Tarantool has a number of memory managers used for different purposes.
They include **slab_arena**, **slab_cache** system, **mempool**,
**small** allocator, **region** allocator and **matras**, which are
organized hierarchically. To understand what it really means, you need
to pass through the following guide. Let's start from the **arena**, as
far as it is the root of this hierarchy.

## Arena

Arena is responsible for allocating relatively large aligned memory
blocks (called **slabs**) of the given size. It also preallocates quite
a lot of memory (depending on overall **quota**).

### Arena definition

```c
/**
 * slab_arena -- a source of large aligned blocks of memory.
 * MT-safe.
 * Uses a lock-free LIFO to maintain a cache of used slabs.
 * Uses a lock-free quota to limit allocating memory.
 * Never returns memory to the operating system.
 */
struct slab_arena {
        /**
         * A lock free list of cached slabs.
         * Initially there are no cached slabs, only arena.
         * As slabs are used and returned to arena, the cache is
         * used to recycle them.
         */
        struct lf_lifo cache;
        /** A preallocated arena of size = prealloc. */
        void *arena;
        /**
         * How much memory is preallocated during initialization
         * of slab_arena.
         */
        size_t prealloc;
        /**
         * How much memory in the arena has
         * already been initialized for slabs.
         */
        size_t used;
        /**
         * An external quota to which we must adhere.
         * A quota exists to set a common limit on two arenas.
         */
        struct quota *quota;
        /*
         * Each object returned by arena_map() has this size.
         * The size is provided at arena initialization.
         * It must be a power of 2 and large enough
         * (at least 64kb, since the two lower bytes are
         * used for ABA counter in the lock-free list).
         * Returned pointers are always aligned by this size.
         *
         * It's important to keep this value moderate to
         * limit the overhead of partially populated slabs.
         * It is still necessary, however, to make it settable,
         * to allow allocation of large objects.
         * Typical value is 4Mb, which makes it possible to
         * allocate objects of size up to ~1MB.
         */
        uint32_t slab_size;
        /**
         * SLAB_ARENA_ flags for mmap() and madvise() calls.
         */
        int flags;
};
```

### Arena methods

Arena is created with specific **quota**, **slab** size and
preallocated memory. It uses mmap for allocation.

```c
int
slab_arena_create(struct slab_arena *arena, struct quota *quota,
                  size_t prealloc, uint32_t slab_size, int flags)
{
        lf_lifo_init(&arena->cache);
        VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED(&arena->cache, sizeof(struct lf_lifo));

        /*
         * Round up the user supplied data - it can come in
         * directly from the configuration file. Allow
         * zero-size arena for testing purposes.
         */
        arena->slab_size = small_round(MAX(slab_size, SLAB_MIN_SIZE));

        arena->quota = quota;
        /** Prealloc can not be greater than the quota */
        prealloc = MIN(prealloc, quota_total(quota));
        /** Extremely large sizes can not be aligned properly */
        prealloc = MIN(prealloc, SIZE_MAX - arena->slab_size);
        /* Align prealloc around a fixed number of slabs. */
        arena->prealloc = small_align(prealloc, arena->slab_size);

        arena->used = 0;

        slab_arena_flags_init(arena, flags);

        if (arena->prealloc) {
                arena->arena = mmap_checked(arena->prealloc,
                                            arena->slab_size,
                                            arena->flags);
        } else {
                arena->arena = NULL;
        }

        madvise_checked(arena->arena, arena->prealloc, arena->flags);

        return arena->prealloc && !arena->arena ? -1 : 0;
}
```

<a name="slab_map"></a>

Most importantly, arena allows us to map a **slab**. First, we check the
list of returned **slabs**, called **arena** cache (not
**slab cache**), which contains previously used and now emptied slabs.
If there are no such **slabs**, we confirm that **quota** limit is
fulfilled and then either take **slab** from the **preallocated** area
or allocate it.

```c
void *
slab_map(struct slab_arena *arena)
{
        void *ptr;
        if ((ptr = lf_lifo_pop(&arena->cache))) {
                VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED(ptr, arena->slab_size);
                return ptr;
        }

        if (quota_use(arena->quota, arena->slab_size) < 0)
                return NULL;

        /** Need to allocate a new slab. */
        size_t used = pm_atomic_fetch_add(&arena->used, arena->slab_size);
        used += arena->slab_size;
        if (used <= arena->prealloc) {
                ptr = arena->arena + used - arena->slab_size;
                VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED(ptr, arena->slab_size);
                return ptr;
        }

        ptr = mmap_checked(arena->slab_size, arena->slab_size,
                           arena->flags);
        if (!ptr) {
                __sync_sub_and_fetch(&arena->used, arena->slab_size);
                quota_release(arena->quota, arena->slab_size);
        }

        madvise_checked(ptr, arena->slab_size, arena->flags);

        VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED(ptr, arena->slab_size);
        return ptr;
}
```

<a name="slab_unmap"></a>

Of course, we can also return one to an **arena**. In this case, we push
 it into the previously mentioned list of returned **slabs** to get it back
faster next time.

```c
void
slab_unmap(struct slab_arena *arena, void *ptr)
{
        if (ptr == NULL)
                return;

        lf_lifo_push(&arena->cache, ptr);
        VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_NOACCESS(ptr, arena->slab_size);
        VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED(lf_lifo(ptr), sizeof(struct lf_lifo));
}
```

## Slab cache

Slab cache allows us to get a piece of **arena slab** with the size
close to needed. It implements a buddy system, which means that we get
**slabs** of the size that is a power of 2 (**arena slab**, which size
is also power of 2, is being divided until we get the chunk of the
appropriate size, or we just get corresponding already available chunk),
and then, when it is freed, we look for its **neighbour (buddy)** to
**merge** them, if the neighbour is also free, to avoid **fragmentation**.

### Slab & slab cache definition

```c
struct slab {
        /*
         * Next slab in the list of allocated slabs. Unused if
         * this slab has a buddy. Sic: if a slab is not allocated
         * but is made by a split of a larger (allocated) slab,
         * this member got to be left intact, to not corrupt
         * cache->allocated list.
         */
        struct rlist next_in_cache;
        /** Next slab in slab_list->slabs list. */
        struct rlist next_in_list;

         * when requested size is bigger than SLAB_MAX_SIZE
         * (i.e. slab->order is SLAB_CLASS_LAST).
         */
        size_t size;
        /** Slab magic (for sanity checks). */
        uint32_t magic;

        uint8_t order;
        /**
         * Only used for buddy slabs. If the buddy of the current
         * free slab is also free, both slabs are merged and
         * a free slab of the higher order emerges.
         * Value of 0 means the slab is free. Otherwise
         * slab->in_use is set to slab->order + 1.

### Slab cache methods

<a name="slab_get_with_order"></a>

Most importantly, it allows us to acquire a **slab** of needed
**order**. We first look through **orders** array of **slab** lists,
starting from the given **order**. We can use slabs of higher
**order**. In case nothing is found, we are trying to get a new
**arena slab** using previously described **arena** method
[slab_map](#slab_map). We preprocess it and add it to the corresponding
lists. Then we are splitting the **slab** if the **order** doesn't
match exactly.

```c
struct slab *
slab_get_with_order(struct slab_cache *cache, uint8_t order)
{
        assert(order <= cache->order_max);
        struct slab *slab;
        /* Search for the first available slab. If a slab
         * of a bigger size is found, it can be split.
         * If cache->order_max is reached and there are no
         * free slabs, allocate a new one on arena.
         */
        struct slab_list *list= &cache->orders[order];

        for ( ; rlist_empty(&list->slabs); list++) {
                if (list == cache->orders + cache->order_max) {
                        slab = slab_map(cache->arena);
                        if (slab == NULL)
                                return NULL;
                        slab_create(slab, cache->order_max,
                                    cache->arena->slab_size);
                        slab_poison(slab);
                        slab_list_add(&cache->allocated, slab,
                                      next_in_cache);
                        slab_list_add(list, slab, next_in_list);
                        break;
                }
        }
        slab = rlist_shift_entry(&list->slabs, struct slab, next_in_list);
        if (slab->order != order) {
                /*
                 * Do not "bill" the size of this slab to this
                 * order, to prevent double accounting of the
                 * same memory.
                 */
                list->stats.total -= slab->size;
                /* Get a slab of the right order. */
                do {
                        slab = slab_split(cache, slab);
                } while (slab->order != order);
                /*
                 * Count the slab in this order. The buddy is
                 * already taken care of by slab_split.
                 */
                cache->orders[slab->order].stats.total += slab->size;
        }
        slab_set_used(cache, slab);
        slab_assert(cache, slab);
        return slab;
}
```

<a name="slab_get_large"></a>

There is an option to get a **slab** of the **order** bigger than
**order_max**. It will be allocated independently using **malloc**.

```c
struct slab *
slab_get_large(struct slab_cache *cache, size_t size)
{
        size += slab_sizeof();
        if (quota_use(cache->arena->quota, size) < 0)
                return NULL;
        struct slab *slab = (struct slab *) malloc(size);
        if (slab == NULL) {
                quota_release(cache->arena->quota, size);
                return NULL;
        }

        slab_create(slab, cache->order_max + 1, size);
        slab_list_add(&cache->allocated, slab, next_in_cache);
        cache->allocated.stats.used += size;
        VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_ALLOC(cache, slab_data(slab),
                               slab_capacity(slab));
        return slab;
}
```

<a name="slab_put_large"></a>

Large **slabs** are being freed when not needed anymore, there is no
**cache** or something like that for them.

```c
void
slab_put_large(struct slab_cache *cache, struct slab *slab)
{
        slab_assert(cache, slab);
        assert(slab->order == cache->order_max + 1);
        /*
         * Free a huge slab right away, we have no
         * further business to do with it.
         */
        size_t slab_size = slab->size;
        slab_list_del(&cache->allocated, slab, next_in_cache);
        cache->allocated.stats.used -= slab_size;
        quota_release(cache->arena->quota, slab_size);
        slab_poison(slab);
        VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_FREE(cache, slab_data(slab));
        free(slab);
        return;
}
```

When the normal **slab** is being emptied, it is processed in a more
specific way, as mentioned above. We get its **buddy** (neighbour
**slab** of the same size, which complements current **slab** to the
**slab** of the next **order**). if **buddy** is not in use and is not
split into smaller parts, we **merge** them and get free **slab** of
the next **order**, thus avoiding fragmentation. If we get an
**arena slab** as the result, we return it to **arena** using its
method [slab_unmap](#slab_unmap) in case there is already an
**arena slab** in **cache**. Otherwise, we leave it in **slab cache** to
avoid extra moves.

```c
/** Return a slab back to the slab cache. */
void
slab_put_with_order(struct slab_cache *cache, struct slab *slab)
{
        slab_assert(cache, slab);
        assert(slab->order <= cache->order_max);
        /* An "ordered" slab is returned to the cache. */
        slab_set_free(cache, slab);
        struct slab *buddy = slab_buddy(cache, slab);
        /*
         * The buddy slab could also have been split into a pair
         * of smaller slabs, the first of which happens to be
         * free. To not merge with a slab which is in fact
         * partially occupied, first check that slab orders match.
         *
         * A slab is not accounted in "used" or "total" counters
         * if it was split into slabs of a lower order.
         * cache->orders statistics only contains sizes of either
         * slabs returned by slab_get, or present in the free
         * list. This ensures that sums of cache->orders[i].stats
         * match the totals in cache->allocated.stats.
         */
        if (buddy && buddy->order == slab->order && slab_is_free(buddy)) {
                cache->orders[slab->order].stats.total -= slab->size;
                do {
                        slab = slab_merge(cache, slab, buddy);
                        buddy = slab_buddy(cache, slab);
                } while (buddy && buddy->order == slab->order &&
                         slab_is_free(buddy));
                cache->orders[slab->order].stats.total += slab->size;
        }
        slab_poison(slab);
        if (slab->order == cache->order_max &&
            !rlist_empty(&cache->orders[slab->order].slabs)) {
                /*
                 * Largest slab should be returned to arena, but we do so
                 * only if the slab cache has at least one slab of that size
                 * in order to avoid oscillations.
                 */
                assert(slab->size == cache->arena->slab_size);
                slab_list_del(&cache->allocated, slab, next_in_cache);
                cache->orders[slab->order].stats.total -= slab->size;
                slab_unmap(cache->arena, slab);
        } else {
                /* Put the slab to the cache */
                rlist_add_entry(&cache->orders[slab->order].slabs, slab,
                                next_in_list);
        }
}
```

## Mempool

Mempool is used to allocate small objects through splitting
**slab cache ordered slabs** into pieces of the equal size. This is
extremely helpful for vast amounts of fast allocations. On creation we
need to specify object size for a **memory pool**. Thus, the possible object
count is calculated, and we get the **memory pool** with int64_t aligned
**offset** ready for allocations. **Mempool** works with **slab** wrap
called **mslab**, which is needed to cut it in pieces.

### MSlab & mempool definitions

### Mempool methods

Creating **mempool** and **mslab** (from **slab**) is quite trivial,
though still worth looking at.

 * it will contain.

 * objsize must be >= sizeof(mbitmap_t)
 * If allocated objects must be aligned, then objsize must
 * be aligned. The start of free area in a slab is always
 * uint64_t aligned.

<a name="mempool_alloc"></a>

Most importantly, mempool allows to allocate memory for a small object.
This allocation is the most frequent in **tarantool**. Memory piece is
being given solely based on the provided mempool. The first problem is
to find a suitable **slab**. If there is an appropriate slab, already
acquired from **slab cache** and still available, it will be used.
Otherwise, we might get totally free **cached slab** not yet returned to the
arena. In case there are no such slabs, we will try to perform possibly
heavier operation, trying to get a slab from the **slab cache** through
its [slab_get_with_order](#slab_get_with_order) method. As the last
resort we are trying to get a **cold slab**, the type of **slab** which
is mostly filled, but has one freed block.
This **slab** is being added to **hot** list, and then, finally, we are
acquiring direct pointer through *mslab_alloc*, using **mslab** offset,
shifting as we allocate new pieces.

```c
void *
mempool_alloc(struct mempool *pool)
{
        struct mslab *slab = pool->first_hot_slab;

<a name="mslab_free"></a>

There is a possibility to free memory from each allocated small object.
Each **mslab** has **free_list** -- list of emptied chunks. It is being
updated according to the new emptied area pointer. Then we decide where
to place processed **mslab**: it will be either **hot** one, **cold**
one, or **spare** one, depending on the new free chunks amount.

```c
void
mslab_free(struct mempool *pool, struct mslab *slab, void *ptr)

        VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK(ptr, 0);
        VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED(ptr, sizeof(void *));

        slab->nfree++;

```

## Small

On the top of **allocators**, listed above, we have one more -- the one
actually used to allocate tuples. Basically, here we are trying to find a
suitable **mempool** to perform [mempool_alloc](#mempool_alloc) on it.
Small system introduces **stepped** and **factored** pools to fit
different **allocation** sizes. There is an array of **stepped** pools,
which are intended to contain relatively small objects. Their
**objsize**s (struct [mempool](#mempool) field) are under about 500
bytes and differ by predefined *STEP_SIZE*. There are also **factored**
pools, which are intended to be used for bigger objects. They are
called **factored** as far as each of them can contain objects from
size *sz* to size *alloc_factor * sz*, where *alloc_factor* may be
adjusted by the user. **Factored** pools are only being created for a given
size if needed, and their amount is limited.

### Factor pool & small allocator definitions

```c
struct factor_pool
{
        /** rb_tree entry */
        rb_node(struct factor_pool) node;
        /** the pool itself. */
        struct mempool pool;
        /**
         * Objects starting from this size and up to
         * pool->objsize are stored in this factored
         * pool.
         */
        size_t objsize_min;
        /** next free factor pool in the cache. */
        struct factor_pool *next;
};

/** A slab allocator for a wide range of object sizes. */

         * pointer its slab and then the pool.
         */
        /**

        struct factor_pool *factor_pool_next;
        /**
         * A red-black tree with "factored" pools, i.e.
         * each pool differs from its neighbor by a factor.
         */
        factor_tree_t factor_pools;
        /**
         * List of mempool which objects to be freed if delayed free mode.
         */
        struct lifo delayed;
        /**
         * List of large allocations by malloc() to be freed in delayed mode.
         */
        struct lifo delayed_large;
        /**
         * The factor used for factored pools. Must be > 1.
         * Is provided during initialization.
         */
        float factor;
        uint32_t objsize_max;
        /**
         * Free mode.
         */
        enum small_free_mode free_mode;
        /**
         * Object size of step pool 0 divided by STEP_SIZE, to
         * quickly find the right stepped pool given object size.
         */
        uint32_t step_pool0_step_count;
};
```

### Small methods

Small allocator is created with **slab cache**, which is the
allocations source for it. There is also being prepared
**factored pools** tree, some sane checks for **alignments** and
**alloc_factor** are being performed.

```c
/** Initialize the small allocator. */
void
small_alloc_create(struct small_alloc *alloc, struct slab_cache *cache,
                   uint32_t objsize_min, float alloc_factor)
{
        alloc->cache = cache;
        /* Align sizes. */
        objsize_min = small_align(objsize_min, STEP_SIZE);
        alloc->step_pool0_step_count = (objsize_min - 1) >> STEP_SIZE_LB;
        /* Make sure at least 4 largest objects can fit in a slab. */
        alloc->objsize_max =
                mempool_objsize_max(slab_order_size(cache, cache->order_max));

        if (!(alloc->objsize_max > objsize_min + STEP_POOL_MAX * STEP_SIZE)) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Can't create small alloc, small "
                        "object min size should not be greather than %u\n",
                        alloc->objsize_max - (STEP_POOL_MAX + 1) * STEP_SIZE);
                abort();
        }

        struct mempool *step_pool;
        for (step_pool = alloc->step_pools;
             step_pool < alloc->step_pools + STEP_POOL_MAX;
             step_pool++) {
                mempool_create(step_pool, alloc->cache, objsize_min);
                objsize_min += STEP_SIZE;
        }
        alloc->step_pool_objsize_max = (step_pool - 1)->objsize;
        if (alloc_factor > 2.0)
                alloc_factor = 2.0;

                        alloc->step_pool_objsize_max;
        }
        alloc->factor = alloc_factor;

        /* Initialize the factored pool cache. */
        struct factor_pool *factor_pool = alloc->factor_pool_cache;
        do {

}
```

<a name="smalloc"></a>

Most importantly, **small allocator** allows us to allocate memory for
an object of a given size. Here we start with **garbage collection**.
**Factored pools** are being created when needed on allocation. First
we start with garbage collection. This means we actually deallocate
previously pushed to queues normal and large allocations, using
*mempool_free* with [mslab_free](#mslab_free) under the hood and
[slab_put_large](#slab_put_large) respectively.
Next thing to do is to decide if we can use **stepped pool** for
allocation, or we need to use **factored pool** based on the given object
size. To calculate which **stepped pool** is needed, we divide size
by *STEP_SIZE* using bit shift and subtract predefined the smallest
possible size (already divided by *STEP_SIZE*), as far as sizes don't
start from zero. Thus, we either get the needed pool and may proceed to
[mempool_alloc](#mempool_alloc) or understand that size is too big
for **stepped pools**. Therefore, we will try to find a big enough
**factored pool**. If there is nothing big enough for given **size**,
we will try to use [slab_get_large](#slab_get_large) directly.
Otherwise, we will either proceed to [mempool_alloc](#mempool_alloc) or
try creating smaller **factored pool** (if relevant). If we are not
succeeding with a smaller **factored pool**, we will need to use an
imperfect one. Anyway, finally, we are coming with our pool to
[mempool_alloc](#mempool_alloc) (except the case where we had to try
[slab_get_large](#slab_get_large) instead).

```c
/**

 *
 * Find or create a mempool instance of the right size,
 * and allocate the object on the pool.

 * shifts. Otherwise, look up a pool in the red-black
 * factored pool tree.

## Interim conclusion

By now we got partly familiar with the hierarchy of memory managers in
**tarantool**. Described subsystems are explicitly organized, while
**region** allocator and **matras** are standing a bit on the side.
Basically, we have a number of functions, providing service on their
level as following:  
.[slab_map](#slab_map)<br/>
..[slab_get_with_order](#slab_get_with_order)<br/>
...[mempool_alloc](#mempool_alloc)<br/>
....[smalloc](#smalloc)<br/>
Or, alternatively<br/>
.[slab_get_large](#slab_get_large)<br/>
..[smalloc](#smalloc)

While [smalloc](#smalloc) is only used for tuple allocation,
[mempool_alloc](#mempool_alloc) is widely used for internal needs.
It is used by **curl**, **http** module, **iproto**,
**fibers** and other subsystems. Alongside with many other
**allocations**, the most interesting one is *memtx_index_extent_alloc*
function, used as the allocation function for **memtx index** needs by
**matras**, which works in pair with *memtx_index_extent_reserve*.
*memtx_index_extent_reserve* is being called when we are going to
**build** or **rebuild index** to make sure that we have enough
**reserved extents**. Otherwise, *memtx_index_extent_reserve* tries to
allocate **extents** until we get the given number and aborts if it
can't be done. This allows us to stick to consistency and abort the
operation before it is too late.

[memtx_index_extent_reserve](#memtx_index_extent_reserve) is mostly
used within *memtx_space_replace_all_keys*, which basically handles
all **updates, replaces** and **deletes**, which makes it very
frequently called function. Here is the interesting fact: in case of
**update** or **replace** we assume that we need
**16 reserved extents** to guarantee success, while for **delete**
operation we only need **8 reserved extents**. The interesting thing
here is that we don't want
[memtx_index_extent_reserve](#memtx_index_extent_reserve) to fail on
**delete**. The idea is that even when we don't have 16 reserved
extents, we will have at least 8 reserved extents and **delete**
operation won't fail. However, there are situations, when reserved
extents number might be 0, when user starts to **delete**, for example,
in case we are **creating index** before deletion and it fails.
Though deletion fail is still hard to reproduce, although it seems to
be possible.

## Matras

Matras is a **memory address translation allocator**, providing aligned
identifiable blocks of specified size. It is designed to maintain index
with versioning and consistent read views. It is organized as a 3-level
tree, where level 1 is an array of pointers to level 2 extents, level 2
extent is an array of pointers to level 3 extents, and level 3 extent
is an array of blocks. Block id so far consists of 3 parts (11, 11 and
10 bits), respectively pointing at level 1, level 2 and level 3 extents.

### Matras definition

Matras uses allocation func determined on creation, which actually is
[mempool_alloc](#mempool_alloc) wrapped into
[memtx_index_extent_alloc](#memtx_index_extent_alloc).

```c
/**
 * sruct matras_view represents appropriate mapping between
 * block ID and it's pointer.
 * matras structure has one main read/write view, and a number
 * of user created read-only views.
 */
struct matras_view {
        /* root extent of the view */
        void *root;
        /* block count in the view */
        matras_id_t block_count;
        /* all views are linked into doubly linked list */
        struct matras_view *prev_view, *next_view;
};

/**
 * matras - memory allocator of blocks of equal
 * size with support of address translation.
 */
struct matras {
        /* Main read/write view of the matras */
        struct matras_view head;
        /* Block size (N) */
        matras_id_t block_size;
        /* Extent size (M) */
        matras_id_t extent_size;
        /* Numberof allocated extents */
        matras_id_t extent_count;
        /* binary logarithm  of maximum possible created blocks count */
        matras_id_t log2_capacity;
        /* See "Shifts and masks explanation" below  */
        matras_id_t shift1, shift2;
        /* See "Shifts and masks explanation" below  */
        matras_id_t mask1, mask2;
        /* External extent allocator */
        matras_alloc_func alloc_func;
        /* External extent deallocator */
        matras_free_func free_func;
        /* Argument passed to extent allocator */
        void *alloc_ctx;
};
```

### Matras methods

Matras creation is quite self-explanatory. Shifts and masks are used to
determine ids for level 1, 2 & 3 extents in the following way:
*N1 = ID >> shift1*, *N2 = (ID & mask1) >> shift2*, *N3 = ID & mask2*.

```c
/**
 * Initialize an empty instance of pointer translating
 * block allocator. Does not allocate memory.
 */
void
matras_create(struct matras *m, matras_id_t extent_size, matras_id_t block_size,
              matras_alloc_func alloc_func, matras_free_func free_func,
              void *alloc_ctx)
{
        /*extent_size must be power of 2 */
        assert((extent_size & (extent_size - 1)) == 0);
        /*block_size must be power of 2 */
        assert((block_size & (block_size - 1)) == 0);
        /*block must be not greater than the extent*/
        assert(block_size <= extent_size);
        /*extent must be able to store at least two records*/
        assert(extent_size > sizeof(void *));

        m->head.block_count = 0;
        m->head.prev_view = 0;
        m->head.next_view = 0;
        m->block_size = block_size;
        m->extent_size = extent_size;
        m->extent_count = 0;
        m->alloc_func = alloc_func;
        m->free_func = free_func;
        m->alloc_ctx = alloc_ctx;

        matras_id_t log1 = matras_log2(extent_size);
        matras_id_t log2 = matras_log2(block_size);
        matras_id_t log3 = matras_log2(sizeof(void *));
        m->log2_capacity = log1 * 3 - log2 - log3 * 2;
        m->shift1 = log1 * 2 - log2 - log3;
        m->shift2 = log1 - log2;
        m->mask1 = (((matras_id_t)1) << m->shift1) - ((matras_id_t)1);
        m->mask2 = (((matras_id_t)1) << m->shift2) - ((matras_id_t)1);
}
```

Allocation using matras requires relatively complicated calculations
due to 3-level extents tree.

```c
/**
 * Allocate a new block. Return both, block pointer and block
 * id.
 *
 * @retval NULL failed to allocate memory
 */
void *
matras_alloc(struct matras *m, matras_id_t *result_id)
{
        assert(m->head.block_count == 0 ||
                matras_log2(m->head.block_count) < m->log2_capacity);

        /* Current block_count is the ID of new block */
        matras_id_t id = m->head.block_count;

        /* See "Shifts and masks explanation" for details */
        /* Additionally we determine if we must allocate extents.
         * Basically,
         * if n1 == 0 && n2 == 0 && n3 == 0, we must allocate root extent,
         * if n2 == 0 && n3 == 0, we must allocate second level extent,
         * if n3 == 0, we must allocate third level extent.
         * Optimization:
         * (n1 == 0 && n2 == 0 && n3 == 0) is identical to (id == 0)
         * (n2 == 0 && n3 == 0) is identical to (id & mask1 == 0)
         */
        matras_id_t extent1_available = id;
        matras_id_t n1 = id >> m->shift1;
        id &= m->mask1;
        matras_id_t extent2_available = id;
        matras_id_t n2 = id >> m->shift2;
        id &= m->mask2;
        matras_id_t extent3_available = id;
        matras_id_t n3 = id;

        void **extent1, **extent2;
        char *extent3;

        if (extent1_available) {
                extent1 = (void **)m->head.root;
        } else {
                extent1 = (void **)matras_alloc_extent(m);
                if (!extent1)
                        return 0;
                m->head.root = (void *)extent1;
        }

        if (extent2_available) {
                extent2 = (void **)extent1[n1];
        } else {
                extent2 = (void **)matras_alloc_extent(m);
                if (!extent2) {
                        if (!extent1_available) /* was created */
                                matras_free_extent(m, extent1);
                        return 0;
                }
                extent1[n1] = (void *)extent2;```
        }

        if (extent3_available) {
                extent3 = (char *)extent2[n2];
        } else {
                extent3 = (char *)matras_alloc_extent(m);
                if (!extent3) {
                        if (!extent1_available) /* was created */
                                matras_free_extent(m, extent1);
                        if (!extent2_available) /* was created */
                                matras_free_extent(m, extent2);
                        return 0;
                }
                extent2[n2] = (void *)extent3;
        }

        *result_id = m->head.block_count++;
        return (void *)(extent3 + n3 * m->block_size);
}
```
